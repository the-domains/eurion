  Payments and transactional capabilities are no longer strictly the domain of a
  few, largely closed players. Today’s increasingly mobile and payments-focused
  environment requires faster deployment, greater interconnectivity among
  systems and strict compliance – and all under the right economics.
   
  As a result, financial and non-financial institutions around the globe are
  increasingly turning to fintech companies – specialists with the experience,
  credentials and highly sophisticated tools to accelerate innovation. In
  addition, new cloud and license-based models are replacing the traditional
  owned, on-premise, CapEx intensive approach to technology.
   
  NovoPayment’s Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering facilitates the creation
  of new products and services and the integration of third party systems via a
  bank-grade, highly scalable, and cost-effective model.
